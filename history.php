					<h2>Our History...</h2>
					<div class='history-content'>
						<p>
						The History of Luckhoff is the history of a community stretching from Stellenbosch to the Southern Cape, Northern Cape, Namibia (Previous South West Africa) as well as abroad. <br /><br />
						</p>

						<p>
						Secondary education for those other than white only started to receive attention around 1919.<br /><br />
						</p>

						<p>
						The situation in Stellenbosch became unbearable for concerned parents. Resulting in parents and missionaries appeal for such a school. The suggestion of a secondary school was raised in the Stellenbosch School Board meeting in 1932. Key to this discussion was Rev Weber of the Rhenish Missionary Society, Rev A.F. Louw, Dr. G.G. Cillie of Stellenbosch University and others.<br /><br />
						</p>

						<p>
						The idea of a Secondary school was approved by the Cape's General Superintendant of education, provided they move Std 5 & 6 missionary learners to a new school.<br /><br />
						</p>

						<p>
						Numerous challenges followed e.g. the use of Old Rozenhof blg in Plein Str. as well as a building in Van Ryneveld (now Ryneveld) Streets were turned down. Farmers complained about closure of roards or sites were found to be unsuitable.<br /><br />
						</p>

						<p>
						The Department of Education even rented the Old Wesleyan (Methodist) school located where the Town Hall is today. This accomodation was vandalised during the December school holidays resulting in the resignation of the school principan Mr E. Moses.<br /><br />
						</p>

						<p>
						Learners were accomodated in a house of Mr. W. Lamberts, Andringa and later also in a house of Mr. Alexander in Muller Streets.<br /><br />
						</p>

						<p>
						Finally an arrangement was made to build Luckhoff High School in Banhoek Rd on land belonging to the Wesleyan (Methodist) Church. The building process ran months behind schedule<br /><br />
						</p>

						<p>
						Recommended name Luckhoff School named after the Rhenish Missionary Rev Paul Daniel Luckhof was approved.<br /><br />
						</p>

						<p>
						On 20th May 1939 keys were handed to Dr G.G. Cillie by the builder G. Blake to ceremoniously unlock the doors to learning.<br /><br />
